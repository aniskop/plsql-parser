The goal of the project &ndash; create Oracle PL/SQL parser, which operates the same syntactic blocks, which are described in Oracle documentation. This means that the parse tree produced by the parser has the same structure (or at least very close) as the one presented in Oracle docs. Also parser rules are named after the Oracle docs (with some exceptions) to keep straightforward mapping.

Oracle docs used:
* [Database PL/SQL Language Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/20/lnpls/index.html)

# Supported syntax elements

* [Anonymous block](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/20/lnpls/overview.html#GUID-826B070B-4888-4398-889B-61A3C6B91349)
